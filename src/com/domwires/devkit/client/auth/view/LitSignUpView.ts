                    You are on my home page. To the north lies <a href="/blog">my blog</a>, from
                    whence the sounds of battle can be heard. To the east you can see a large
                    mountain, upon which many <a href="/school">school papers</a> are littered.
                    Far up thus mountain you can spy a little figure who appears to be me,
                    desperately scribbling a <a href="/school/thesis">thesis</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the west are several exits. One fun-looking exit is labeled
                    <a href="https://games.example.com/">"games"</a>. Another more
                    boring-looking exit is labeled <a href="https://isp.example.net/">ISPâ„¢</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the south lies a dark and dank <a href="/about">contacts page</a>.
                    Cobwebs cover its disused entrance, and at one point you see a rat run
                    quickly out of the page.
